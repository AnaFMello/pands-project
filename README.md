Summary Of The Fisher's Iris Dataset

The Iris flower dataset is a well-known multivariate dataset that was designed by British statistician and geneticist Ronald Aylmer Fisher as an example of discriminant analysis. It includes 150 cases (rows) and 5 variables (columns), which are Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, and Species. The data comprises of three different species of the Iris flower: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor.

The primary objective of the discriminant analysis is to create a simple function that can classify a flower correctly based on the four measurements. This forms the foundation of developing "predictors" to enhance accuracy in dataset records.

In 1935, an American botanist named Edgar Anderson gathered data on the three distinct Iris species from the Gaspé Peninsula in Québec province, eastern Canada. The specimens were collected on the same day, by the same person, and measured using the same instruments.

Ronald Fisher utilized Anderson's data in 1936 to determine whether linear regression could be used to maximize the ratio of the difference between the specific means to the standard deviations within species. As a result, the Iris flower dataset has gained immense recognition as the "Hello World" in Data Analysis.
